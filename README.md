These are the LaTeX source files for my academic CV.

## Download

Download my CV:

- [English version](https://github.com/seisman/cv/raw/gh-pages/DTian_cv_en.pdf)
- [Chinese version](https://github.com/seisman/cv/raw/gh-pages/DTian_cv_cn.pdf)

## Build

To build the CV, you need to have LaTeX installed. The full LaTeX distribution (e.g.,
TeXLive on Linux or MacTeX on macOS) are usually too big (>5 GB).

I recommend to install the lightweight [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/en-US/index.html)
which automatically downloads necessary dependencies.

1.  Install Tectonic:

        curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://drop-sh.fullyjustified.net | sh

2. 	Build the CV:

		make
